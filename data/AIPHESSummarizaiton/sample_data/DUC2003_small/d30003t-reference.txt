British authorities arrested General Augusto Pinochet, in London for back surgery, on an international warrant issued by Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon.
The Madrid court charged Pinochet, who ruled Chile as a despot for 17 years, with crimes against humanity, including genocide and terrorism, involving the deaths of more than 4,000 people.
The Chilean government protested that Pinochet, now a "senator-for-life," has legal immunity, but few in Chilean society protested the arrest.
Pinochet's arrest shows the growing significance of international human-rights law, suggesting that officials accused of atrocities have fewer places to hide these days, even if they are carrying diplomatic passports.

Augusto Pinochet, former Chilean dictator, was arrested in London on 14 October 1998.
Pinochet, 82, was recovering from surgery.
The arrest was in response to an extradition warrant served by Baltasar Garzon, a maverick Spanish judge.
Pinochet was charged with murdering thousands, including many Spaniards.
Pinochet is awaiting a hearing, his fate in the balance.
Chile protested, insisting that Pinochet had diplomatic immunity.
Britain disagreed.
The reaction of the Chilean people was mixed.
American scholars applauded the arrest, saying that it set a precedent for other terrorist dictators.
Castro criticized the arrest, and called it unprecedented international meddling.
